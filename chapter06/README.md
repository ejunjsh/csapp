assume

Bits Per Track

    bpt = x * r * K


Track Count

    tc = (1-x) * r * M


M, K are constant

so

Bit Count

    bc = K * M * r^2 * (1-x) * x

when x == 1/2, bc is maximum

## 6.23

    T_avg_seek = 4ms

    T_avg_rotation = 1/2 * 1/15000 * 60s/min * 1000ms/s = 2ms

    T_avg_transfer = 1/15000 * 1/800 * 60s/min * 1000ms/s = 0.005ms

    so

    T_access = 6.005ms
